A multithreaded Python-based port scanner that scans a range of TCP ports on a target host and performs basic service detection using common ports and banner grabbing.

##  Features

- Scans TCP ports on any target IP/hostname
- Detects common services (HTTP, SSH, FTP, etc.)
- Simple banner grabbing for open ports
- Multithreaded for faster scanning
- Works cross-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac)

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries required (uses only `socket`, `threading`, and `sys`)
